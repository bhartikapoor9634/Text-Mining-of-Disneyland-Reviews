In this paper, different topic modelling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), 
Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Gibbs Sampling 
Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (GSDMM) are implemented on the reviews given by visitors to 
three Disneyland Branches- Hong Kong, Paris, California. The aim of the model is to form 
groups of similar patterns in the reviews. This study will help Disneyland to identify reviews 
based on particular features such as food, price, facilities, etc leading them to improve 
themselves. The behaviour of all the implemented techniques are compared to choose the 
best suitable method.
